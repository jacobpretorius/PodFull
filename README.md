# PodFull

An ASP.NET 4.7 MVC podcast episode blog framework built for speed and getting things right. Fully functional with the minimum required features to make a podcast website using Soundcloud as the audio hosting provider (free).

Adapted from the super fast blog framework [BlogFull](https://github.com/jacobpretorius/BlogFull), changed the way posts/episodes are identified and removed some features from BlogFull not needed here. Added Soundcloud embed support for each episode, simply paste the full Soundcloud embed code into the text box and it will be formatted automatically.
